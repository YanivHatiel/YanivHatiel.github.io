  description: "Background\nWhat if we didn't create another building, but a new layer\
    \ of the landscape were ground, ceiling, and nature work as a set? \n\nAfter all,\
    \ the existing Portuguese landscape does not need an otherness that will diverge\
    \ or ignore the current conditions and natural beauty. Instead, we aim to transform\
    \ the area in a way that will not disrupt a primary reading of the existing and\
    \ valued landscape but to achieve a balance between the current and the imposed\
    \ landscape.\nthe project is preoccupied with the landscape in a conceptual way\
    \ to enrich/stimulate yoga practice and in a morphological way where the architectural\
    \ artifact doesn't compete with the rural environment, but it becomes the landscape\
    \ itself.\nthe idea of a duplicated ground that doesn't only merge with the existing\
    \ landscape but also establishes relationships in multiple levels and directions\
    \ for the user by working as a ‘bridge’ between the fragmented parts of the landscape.\n\
    By folding the roof, the solar radiation on the western facade has been decreased\
    \ by 85% compared to a conventional solution."
