  description: "Background\nWhat if we didn't create another building, but a new layer\
    \ of the landscape were ground, ceiling, and nature work as a set? \n\nAfter all,\
    \ the existing Portuguese landscape does not need an otherness that will diverge\
    \ or ignore the current conditions and natural beauty. Instead, we aim to transform\
    \ the area in a way that will not disrupt a primary reading of the existing and\
    \ valued landscape but to achieve a balance between the current and the imposed\
    \ landscape.\nthe project is preoccupied with the landscape in a conceptual way\
    \ to enrich/stimulate yoga practice and in a morphological way where the architectural\
    \ artifact doesn't compete with the rural environment, but it becomes the landscape\
    \ itself.\nthe idea of a duplicated ground that doesn't only merge with the existing\
    \ landscape but also establishes relationships in multiple levels and directions\
    \ for the user by working as a â€˜bridgeâ€™ between the fragmented parts of the\
    \ landscape.\nBy folding the roof, the solar radiation on the western facade has\
    \ been decreased by 85% compared to a conventional solution."

  description: "A bold new landmark for Moscow, Yandex’s HQ reimagines the tech campus\
    \ as an open, integrated environment—elevated above the city yet deeply connected\
    \ to it. Its sculpted titanium form hovers above a public plaza, inviting interaction,\
    \ culture, and movement. Within, a luminous central hub connects three dynamic\
    \ work wings—encouraging collaboration and permeability. \n\n  Yaniv Hatiel led\
    \ the integration of computational design and BIM on the Yandex Headquarters project,\
    \ spearheading a data-driven approach to façade development through generative\
    \ algorithms and custom evaluation tools. He established cross-platform workflows\
    \ between Rhino and Revit, enabling native geometry delivery at scale. As envelope\
    \ BIM coordinator, he oversaw design integration, model management, and quality\
    \ control. He also introduced VR-based review processes and a generative fit-out\
    \ strategy, setting a precedent for performance-driven design practice."
